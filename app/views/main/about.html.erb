				I got my start producing live theatre in New York City. I dabbled in short films before transitioning into television as a field producer for “America’s Most Wanted” on FOX.  
			</p>
			<p class="resume_text"> These past twelve years working in television, live theater, music videos and film production have brought me to scores of cities throughout the USA and beyond; from haunted castles in England to beach bungalows on remote islands. I thrive on the adventure that comes with every new project, and value the friendships I’ve forged in the field.  
			</p>
			<p class="resume_text">As a production manager, I believe in doing everything possible to make sure the creative team can completely focus on making a quality product. Producers should never worry about how everyone will be transported to and from set. Camera operators should never wonder whether they will have a hot meal after 6 hours. My teams feel supported and appreciated, and that allows them to create the very best project in their power.  
			</p>
			<p class="resume_text"> Over the next decade I see myself moving into Line Producing, and ultimately becoming an Executive in Charge of production.
